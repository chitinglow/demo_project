# Demo Streamlit Project

## Monte Carlo Simulation Web App

This web app is built using Python and Streamlit, 
and it provides a Monte Carlo simulation tutorial based on the content found on [EasyLang.dev](https://easylang.dev/apps/tutorial_mcarlo.html). 

## Credits
This web application was built as a learning exercise using Python and Streamlit. 
The core concept and implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation were inspired by 
the tutorial available on the [EasyLang.dev](https://easylang.dev/apps/tutorial_mcarlo.html) website.

Please visit the EasyLang.dev website to explore more of their content and tutorials.
